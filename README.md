## Instructions

1. Install Python (version 3.11.2 or later).
2. Execute the code by running the following command in terminal (PowerShell, bash, etc.): `python sort.py <width> <height> <length> <mass>`, replacing each placeholder (<>) with the specified value.
3. The program will either print a message similar to: `The package was sorted into the following stack: <returned stack>`, or will print `ERROR: all values must be numeric` if any of the submitted values are not numbers, or `ERROR: all values must be positive` if at least one of the values is 0 or a negative number.
